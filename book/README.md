To make the book pdf from tex file run `make book` (you need a tex package, for example `texlive-full` for Debian). The output will be in `out` directory. Latest built version is in `static`.

Currently the source is one giant tex file `src/fitness-book.tex`. The plan is to split it up by chapters & sections.
