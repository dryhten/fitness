The book is also available at https://fitnessbook.github.io/book.pdf

You can get a paperback version from amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4DQF9HJ

To make the book pdf from tex file run `make book`. The output will be in `out` directory. Latest built version is in `static`.

Currently the source is one giant tex file `src/fitness-book.tex`. The plan is to split it up by chapters & sections.
